My name is Ken Stevens and I am a child of God. I have been many things throughout my life, a father, a computer programmer, a cab driver, etc. but first and foremost I identify as a child of God. I was saved at a firly young age, about 10 or 11. I followed God ever since. It hasn't always been a straight path, but I have always found my way back, or maybe more accurately God called me back. I don't hae a Bible college or seminary education, but I have studied the Bible along the way and I can hold my own in many theological circles. Mostly my blog will be sermonettes or sermons with  a little about what is happening in my life.
