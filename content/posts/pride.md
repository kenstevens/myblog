Back at the close of he sixth century Pope Gregory classified all sins under seven distinct sins.
These were pride, anger, envy, impurity, gluttony, slothfulness, and avarice. These became known
as the Seven Deadly Sins. It is the first one on the list I wish to discuss today. It is Pride.

The question that faces us today is pride ever not a sin. For example, is pride
in your children's accomplishments a sin. Read on, the answer may surprise you.

Refer to Proverbs 6:16-19

      16¬†There are six things that the Lord hates,
      seven that are an abomination to him:
      17¬†haughty eyes, a lying tongue,
      and hands that shed innocent blood,
      18¬†a heart that devises wicked plans,
      feet that make haste to run to evil,
      19¬†a false witness who breathes out lies,
      and one who sows discord among brothers

As it says in verse 16, there are 6 things, then the author, under the
inspiration of God, changes his mind and says 7 things that the Lord hates, no,
wait, he says is an abomination to the Lord. On top of the list is haughty eyes.
The lifting up of one‚Äôs eyelids expresses haughtiness and pride. Pride. That is
on top of the list. At the very least God hates pride and at most he finds it an
abomination.

Now let's refer to Proverbs 8:12-13


      12¬†‚ÄúI, wisdom, dwell with prudence,
      and I find knowledge and discretion.
      13¬†The fear of the Lord is hatred of evil.
      Pride and arrogance and the way of evil
      and perverted speech I hate.

Pride and arrogance again He hates. He doesn't give an exception of pride that
says its OK. Let's look at a few more verses.

Proverbs 21:3-4 says:

      3¬†To do righteousness and justice
      is more acceptable to the Lord than sacrifice.
      4¬†Haughty eyes and a proud heart,
      the lamp of the wicked, are sin.


Haughty eyes and a Proud heart are sin. God does not mince words. He says,
beyond a shadow of a doubt, it's sin.

Let's try a few verses from the New Testament. Mark 7:20-23;

20¬†And he said, ‚ÄúWhat comes out of a person is what defiles him.
21¬†For from within, out of the heart of man, come evil thoughts, sexual
immorality, theft, murder, adultery,
22¬†coveting, wickedness, deceit, sensuality, envy, slander, pride, foolishness.
23¬†All these evil things come from within, and they defile a person.‚Äù

Here, God calls pride an "evil thing".

In 1 Perter 5:5

5¬†Likewise, you who are younger, be subject to the elders. Clothe yourselves,
all of you, with humility toward one another, for ‚ÄúGod opposes the proud but
gives grace to the humble.‚Äù

God opposes the proud, but He gives grace to the humble. So if you are proud God
will oppose you. If you want to live under God's grace be humble.

God's word has many place where it calls pride a sin. It calls pride an
abomination to the Lord. It gives no exceptions of pride being not a sin. So
Pride in your children's accomplish is a sin, lest the child becomes prideful and
boasts.

So, we should experience joy in accomplishments or their child's accomplishments, but never pride.
