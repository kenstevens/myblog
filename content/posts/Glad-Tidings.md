Joy is an essential element of Christmas and the message of the first Christmas was a joyful one. Many people today depend for their Christmas joy on material things like good food, friends, fun, parties, and presents. By contrast the
first Christmas was characterized by cold, bareness, and rejection, and it was in that atmosphere that the angel brought "good tidings of great joy."

  Jesus Christ was born into a world of oppression and cruelty. Palestine was in the grip of Rome and had been, as historians put it, bludgeoned into submission. It was a world of military might, vice, lust, and great wickedness. Romans 1 describes the permissiveness of the world into which Jesus was born. So today we are living in a bad world in which permissiveness is blatant on radio, television, and billboards, and in paperback novels and glossy magazines.

  In spite of centuries of education reform, politics, science and philosophy, the world of the twentieth century, with its permissiveness and pornography, is comparable to that of the first century. Since the world still needs a Savior, the message that Jesus Christ is born today is still good news.

  Since Rome had become master of that ancient world, there were no wars. Warfare is impossible when the people are in subjection. But a subject, terrorized people are a joyless lot. Jesus was born into a world that knew little but sadness and despair. His countrymen were heavily taxed by Rome to keep them submissive. Then came the angel with joyful news as all heaven broke bounds (G. Campbell Morgan). Jesus Christ, God‚ Savior, and Deliverer had been born. He who alone could deal with sin, not just human misery and abjection, had arrived!

  The One who was going to take the sting out of death had been born in Bethlehem and His name was Jesus‚ Savior for He shall save His people from their sins.

  The angel's message was not only to the shepherds; it was to
  all people. It was a universal message. Beginning with humble shepherds and continuing with Wise Men, King Herod, the Jews, then the Gentiles, it soon became known throughout the Roman world. How did the world first hear this good and glad news? After seeing the new-born King for themselves, they went back to their daily work and, on the way and on every day, told others what the angel had told them and what they had seen for themselves.

  After Christmas the holiday is over, we recommence our daily daily and common activities, providing us with opportunities for spreading the good and glad news. The Baby grew up and became a man, the Light of the World, as He described himself: not a Christmas candle that is easily blown out; not Christmas tree lights that go on and off; but a bright and shining perpetual light to our dark world. Leaving His cradle and going to the cross, there we see the Light burning at its brightest. It is finished. What He
  was born to do‚ to save the world from sin‚ He completed upon the cross of Calvary.
